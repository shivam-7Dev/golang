🔐 What is Hashing?
Hashing is the process of converting input data (any size) into a fixed-size string of characters  which is typically a hexadecimal value.
It's used in security, checksums, password storage, and more.


key components
    deterministic:Same input always gives the same output.

    fast computation: Hash functions are designed to be fast. 
                      Go’s standard libraries (like crypto/sha256, crypto/sha512) are optimized and fast.

    pre image resistance: Given a hash, it should be hard to reverse to find the original input.

    collision resistance:Two different inputs shouldn’t have the same hash.
                        SHA-256 and SHA-512 have strong collision resistance, which is why they’re widely used.

    sha 256:

    sha 512:

    salting:Adding random data (a "salt") to input before hashing to avoid predictable hashes — especially for passwords.
