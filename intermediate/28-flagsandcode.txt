Common  Permission Codes

    Code	Meaning (r=read, w=write, x=execute)
    0400	Read by owner
    0200	Write by owner
    0100	Execute by owner
    0040	Read by group
    0020	Write by group

    The third argument to os.OpenFile only matters if the file is being created.
    For just opening (reading/writing) an existing file, 
    you can put any value there and it will still work 
    (as long as you have the OS-level permissions to access the file).
