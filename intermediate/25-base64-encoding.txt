✅ What is Base64 Encoding?


Base64 is a way to encode binary data(like images, files or bytes) into text using only ASCII character.

👉 How it works:

    Takes binary data
    splits it into 6 bit chunk
    maps each chuck to a character for a set of 64 characters


    A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /

    Example:
    Input: "Go!" → bytes: [71 111 33]
    Base64 encoded: "R28h"


❓ Why is Base64 Used?

    Purpose	                                Explanation

    ✅ Safe  transmission	               Binary data (e.g. image, PDF) is not always safe to send over 
                                            email, HTTP, etc. Base64 makes it text-safe.

    🌐 Embedding binary in HTML/JSON    	Base64 lets you store binary files inside strings (e.g., data:image/png;base64,...)

    📦 Encoding passwords, tokens	        Encodes credentials in headers like Authorization: Basic ... (not encryption!)

    ⚠ Not encryption	                    Base64 is not secure, just an encoding mechanism.



📦 Base64 in Go: Use the standard library: encoding/base64

    package main

    import (
        "encoding/base64"
        "fmt"
    )

    func main() {
        input := "Hello Shivam"
        encoded := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(input))
        fmt.Println("Base64 Encoded:", encoded)
    }
