Note: In go arithmetic operatios works with numeric types like int,float 

Operator	Name	             Example (a = 10, b = 3)	 Result
+	        Addition	         a + b	                     13
-	        Subtraction	         a - b	                        7
*	        Multiplication	     a * b	                        30
/	        Division	         a / b	                    3 (for int) or 3.333 (for float64)
%	        Modulus(Remainder)	 a % b	                            1








âœ… Summary

    Use +, -, *, /, % for basic math

    Integer division truncates result

    Explicit type conversion is necessary for mixed types

    Use +=, -=, etc., for compound assignment

    x++ and x-- are statements, not expressions
