Go Inclues a Runtime
    GO binarier inculede a a small runtime that provides features like 
    garbage collection, goroutine,scheduling, and memory sagety.
    THsi runtime is embedded into the complied binary, which is why GO binarier are self contained and
    do not require Go compiler or runtime to be installed on the target system.

1. GO Binarier are statically complied
    when you compile a  GO program(eg go build) the output is a self contained binary.
    this binary includes
        your application code 
        your go standart library
        and the runtime

2. what is GO runtime?
    Its a light weight layer that provides
        Garbage colletion 
        Goroutine scheduling(like lightweihgt threads)
        stack management
        memory safety checks
        Interace method resolution


3. why is it Embedded in the binary?
    
    so that no exteranl dependencies like(Jvm for java or interpreter for python) are needed on the target machine
    YOu can run the binary anyhere that is compatible with the target os and architure


NOTE => if you build code on mac then that binary wont run on ubuntu
        Go's compiler targets the os and cpu architure you're currently on by defaule


How to build cross platform binariers?
    If you want to build a ninary on macOS that run on Ubuntu , yu can use crosspcompilation.
    GO makes this eay by allowing you you specify the targe os and architure during the build process.
    
    GOOS=linux GOARC=amd64 go build -o myapp-linux

    go tool dist list
