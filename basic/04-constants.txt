A constant (const) is a value that cannot be changed during the execution of the program. 
It must be known at compile-time.

    const pi = 3.14159


Type can be inferred or explicit:
    const age = 25           // inferred as untyped int
    const name string = "Shivam"


Rules for constant

    1 must be assigned a  value at declaration
      you cannot declare a constat without assiging a value
        const x   //invalied becasue there is not assignment

    2 cannot use runtime value

        const size = len("hello") // ❌ Invalid
        len() is only valid in array length definitions, not for constants.


GOTChas:

    1.No runtime computation

        var userInput = 5
        const result = userInput + 1  // ❌ ERROR: userInput is not a constant
