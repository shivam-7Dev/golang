    in go, the first letter of an identifier determine its visibiltiy across packages:

    case          exampel            access        used  for 

    PascaleCase   MyFunction         Exported      Public fuction,struct,etc      

    camelCase     myVariable          Unexported    private/internal stuff


    exported: can be accessed from ohter packages
    Unexported : can be accessed only within the smae package


    //example.go

    package example

    var Exorted =16 //Accessible from other packages
    var internal =20 //only inside example package
