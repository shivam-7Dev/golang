No, Go does not have a keyword called while.

But! You can write a while loop using the for keyword — 
because in Go, for is the only loop construct, 
and it’s versatile enough to cover what a while loop does in other languages.

Go while Loop Style
    i := 0
    for i < 5 {
        fmt.Println(i)
        i++
    }
    This behaves just like a traditional while loop in Python, JavaScript, or C.


🔁 Infinite Loop (like while(true))

    for {
        fmt.Println("Looping forever...")
        // break or return to avoid real infinite loop
        break
    }



✅ Summary
    Go doesn’t have while, but you can write it using for condition.

    It behaves the same as a while loop from other languages.

    For infinite loops: for { ... }

    Exit early with break, skip with continue.
