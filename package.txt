In Go, a directory represents a single package,
and all files in that directory must belong to that same package.
This design choice helps maintain clean organization and predictable import behavior.


Summary:
    Each directory = one package
    All files in a directory must declare the same package name
    Move files to different directories if they need to be in different packages
