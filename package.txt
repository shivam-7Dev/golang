In Go, a directory represents a single package,
and all files in that directory must belong to that same package.
This design choice helps maintain clean organization and predictable import behavior.


Summary:
    Each directory = one package
    All files in a directory must declare the same package name
    Move files to different directories if they need to be in different packages



Note=> In Go, file names do not matter for import or usage.
        what really matters is package declaration at the top of each file

        GO thinks in term of package and not filnames

        // file: math_utils.go
        package mathlib

        func Add(a, b int) int {
            return a + b
        }


        // file: subtraction.go
        package mathlib

        func Sub(a, b int) int {
            return a - b
        }

        Even though these are different files,
        since both are in the same package mathlib,
        you can import just the package like:

        import "your-module-name/mathlib"

        mathlib.Add(1, 2)
        mathlib.Sub(5, 3)


âœ… Rules Summary:

âœ… Rule	            ðŸ“„ Description
Package Name	      Must be declared at the top of the file.
File Name	         Can be anything. Itâ€™s just for organization.
Same Package	     All files in the same folder usually belong to the same package.
Folder = Package	  In Go, folder name becomes the import path (used with go.mod).
